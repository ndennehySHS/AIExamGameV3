I found it interesting that it showed how to use $search with $autocomplete rather than a more basic example. It also answered using BsonDocuments which is not the preferred way to query with the C# driver. It should have instead used the Search builder, which simplifies things a lot. It did link to our driver documentation that uses builders.
