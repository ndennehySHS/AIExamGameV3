    - content: In MongoDB, the `$nin` operator is used to select the documents where the specified field value is not in the specified array or the field does not exist. If the field holds an array, then the `$nin` operator selects the documents whose field holds an array with no element equal to a value in the specified array. The `$nin` operator can be used with the `find()` and `updateMany()` methods.

Install Homebrew using the official Homebrew installation instructions.\n\n3. Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap to download the official Homebrew formula for MongoDB and the Database Tools, by running the following command in your macOS Terminal:\n```bash\nbrew tap mongodb/brew\n```\n\n4. To update Homebrew and all existing formulae, run the following command in your macOS Terminal:\n```bash\nbrew update\n```\n\n5. To install MongoDB, run the following command in your macOS Terminal application:\n```bash\nbrew install mongodb-community@7.0\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can specify a previous version of MongoDB if desired. You can also maintain multiple versions of MongoDB side by side in this manner.\n\nTo repeat a command multiple times, you can use a loop in your shell script. For example, to repeat the `mongosh` command 10 times, you can use the following loop in your shell script:\n\n```bash\nfor i in {1..10}\ndo\n  mongosh\ndone\n```\n\nThis will run the `mongosh` command 10 times.
