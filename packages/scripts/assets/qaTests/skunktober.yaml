      role: user
    - content: 'To insert a document into a MongoDB collection with fields for race,
        joke, and stereotype, you can use the `insertOne()` method. Here is an
        example of how to do it in the MongoDB
        shell:\n\n```\ndb.collectionName.insertOne({\n  race: "human",\n  joke:
        "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other
        side!",\n  stereotype: "All humans love chicken"\n})\n```\n\nReplace
        `collectionName` with the name of your collection. If you omit the `_id`
        field, the driver automatically generates a unique `ObjectId` value for
        the `_id` field.'

    - content: "To insert documents into a MongoDB database, you can use the
        `insertMany()` method. The following is an example of inserting two
        documents into the `sample_mflix` database using the `mongosh`
        shell:\\n\\n```shell\\nuse

        collection that contains names and specialties of physicians by defining
        a schema for the collection and inserting documents that conform to that
        schema. Here is an example schema:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  name:
        String,\\n  specialty: String\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can then insert
        documents into the collection using the `insertOne` or `insertMany`
