  Describe the purpose of the page, e.g.:
  “This page shows the driver syntax for several MongoDB commands and links to their related reference and API documentation.”
  
  Provide a table containing columns for “Command” and “Syntax”. Each row contains a different command.
  
  In the “Command” column, provide a human readable description of the command as well as links to API documentation, Usage Example, and Fundamentals page if they exist. 
  
  In the “Syntax” column, provide a code example that demonstrates how to call the command, and sample output if it adds clarity.
